# dotfiles
My personal configurations files

## Instalation

### 1. Dowload source code.

The simplest way is just type on any terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MateusRyu/dotfiles.git
```

Or download de ZIP file from the [repository](https://github.com/MateusRyu/dotfiles) and unzip it!


### 2. Confirm that the scripts have access permission

```bash
chmod +x save.sh
```

### 3. Configure the config file

The config file is (by default) named as `dotfile_config` but you can change this by renaming the `$CONFIG_FILE` variable in the scripts.

## How to use

You can run the `save.sh` script to generate Symlink of the dotfiles in the current folder. After that, you can do a git push to your repository or save it.
